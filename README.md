# deposit-batch-contract

A contract to stake multiple eth2 validator addresses at once. This is
based on Staked.us' public repository (MIT). Additions by skillz:

- trufflization
- add a public interface to query the skillz version (we use it to double-check our internal tools are targetting the right contract)
